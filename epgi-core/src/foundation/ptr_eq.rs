/// A wrapper for reference-counting pointers to perform pointer-based equality comparison.
///
/// The pointer comparison ignores the vtable from the fat reference-counting pointers, as discussed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103763ã€‚
///
/// To avoid a false positive, it is required that the reference-counting pointer implementation must have no pointer aliasing under any circumstances. Most implementations do guarantee no pointer aliasing, including `std`. However, it is theoretically possible to implement a strong-only reference-counting pointer with allocation-free specialization on ZSTs such that ZSTs have pointer aliasing. Such implementations would be considered not standard-conforming after https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/106450.
